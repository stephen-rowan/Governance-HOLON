#### Intial thoughts 

My believe in the Cardano and thus in the Catalyst community is being put to the test. I wanted to make sure the results will help balance between rules (tools) & innovation,  towards a more truthful, decentralised and autonomous organisation. 

Having experienced the ICO craze in 2017 first hand and working in cryptoland since 2016, it became easy to spot red flags. When I saw too many raised in NFTDAO, combined with the fact they already got funded (partially because of what I contributed) and were applying for more funding, I felt it was my civil duty towards my Self and the Cardano community to speak up. 

Over the course of the last two weeks, the departees together with CAs from the Catalyst community created a chat group to figure out how to best make our voices heard. I even took to twitter, since SPOs are quite active there and discussions about the departees report in the Cardano forums were taking place. After one of my replies I was approached by the IOHK due diligence department, to which I explained my view of the events. Last week someone in the group managed to contact Rick McCracken and landed a live interview on his Digital Fortress podcast. We're very thankful to Rick for the opportunity to shine a bit of light on some of the issues, before Fund4 voting ends.


#### Colleagues
Stephen has become a dear friend, colleague and mentor, even before the chat group was created.

Tyler's open minded approach, balanced vibes and agile product design skills were one of the reasons I stayed longer than expected with NFTDAO and I'm very happy to have him currently onboard of the next project I'm working on.

Anamarie and Rares, or Newmindflow as their social handle, together with Andy were the driving creative force in NFTDAO and the wider Catalyst community, seeing them pull their proposals made me sad and I sincerely hope that they will find someone or someone will find them to operate as a human-funding-proposal-abstraction-layer; so they can receive catalyst funding and keep on being creative without having to write proposals or reports üôè

Quinn and I only had contact once very briefly when I showed him our contribution token design draft (on the dev Slack channel). He also offered to help with the minting, as he already wrote a policy script that could do the basics. However that design was not approved and I never heard from Quinn again until I found out he was one of the devs that left. Next time I saw him he was explaining his view of the events in the chat group. I applaude him for doxxing his anon identity in order to make his voice even stronger. However he wasn't able to make it to the DF interview, otherwise there would've been even more to unpack...

Ken, Kyle, Rene M, Steve, Steven, Phil K. Quasar, thank you for your time, attention and commitment to the Catalyst and Cardano community, you are all most appreciated and aggreable beings ‚≠ê ü•á
